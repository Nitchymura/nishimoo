I was born and brought up in Hiroshima ubtil high school, then moved to Kyoto and lived there about 25 years. <br>I love traveling and driving. I've visited all 47 prefectures in Japan. Sometimes I encountered some serious accidents (such as losing my passport at US, pocketpicked my wallet at Paris...), but I also love traveling abroad.<br> I had dedicated about 20 years for figure skating as a competitor since I started it at the age of 19 at the university. Even now, I sometimes go ice skating for fun and health.<br><br>If you are interesed in me, please visit tabs below!</h5>
